    "The time series plot reveals the temporal dynamics of dengue cases. We can observe a clear seasonality, with distinct peaks occurring annually.

This visualization confirms the seasonality observed in the time series plot, showing that cases are predominantly high during the first few months of the year (specifically, months 1 to 5). This period aligns with the Brazilian summer and rainy season, reinforcing the link between climate and dengue incidence.

However, it's worth noting the strong correlations among the climate variables themselves, particularly between `temp_media_mensal` (mean monthly temperature) and `vento_vlc_media_mensal` (mean monthly wind velocity), with a correlation of 0.85. This suggests that these variables might be interdependent.\n",

The current number of cases (`qntd_casos`) shows a much stronger correlation with lagged climate variables, such as `temp_media_lag3` and `vento_media_lag3`. This highlights a crucial finding: climate conditions from previous months are more predictive of current dengue cases than the conditions of the current month.

    "\n",
    "With a clean and well-understood dataset, the next step is to build a predictive model to forecast future dengue cases. This section details the process of training, evaluating, and optimizing a machine learning model for this time-series forecasting task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering: Lag Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the insights from our EDA, which showed a strong correlation between dengue cases and past climate conditions, we engineered **lag features**. These features represent the values of key variables from previous months. Specifically, we created lag features for 3 and 4 months prior (`lag3` and `lag4`) for dengue cases, precipitation, temperature, and wind velocity. This allows the model to capture the delayed effect of these factors on the spread of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish a benchmark for performance, we first trained a **Random Forest Regressor** with default parameters. Random Forest is a robust and effective model for this type of problem, as it can handle non-linear relationships and different data types without extensive preprocessing. The model was trained on a time-series split of the data, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forecast from this baseline model shows that it successfully captures the seasonal pattern and the general trend of dengue cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 6.2 million\n",
    "- **R-squared (R²):** 0.14\n",

    "  <img src=\"../models/baseline_dengue_forecast.png\" alt=\"Baseline Dengue Forecast\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "While the baseline model performs reasonably well, its predictions can be improved by tuning its hyperparameters. We used **Randomized Search Cross-Validation (`RandomizedSearchCV`)** to efficiently search for the best combination of parameters for the Random Forest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of this step was using a `TimeSeriesSplit` cross-validation strategy. This ensures that the model is always trained on past data and evaluated on future data, preventing data leakage and providing a more realistic estimate of its performance on new, unseen data. We ran a \"complete\" search to explore a wide range of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best parameters found were:\n",
    "- `n_estimators`: 500\n",
    "- `min_samples_split`: 5\n",
    "- `min_samples_leaf`: 2\n",
    "- `max_samples`: 0.8\n",
    "- `max_features`: 'sqrt'\n",
    "- `max_depth`: None\n",
    "- `bootstrap`: True\n",
    "\n",
    "The R² in cross-validation was **0.30**, suggesting a promising potential for the model with these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimized Model Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimized model shows a noticeable visual improvement in forecasting accuracy. As seen in the plot below, the predictions align more closely with the actual peaks and valleys of the dengue case numbers, especially for the large outbreak in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** ~6.2 million\n",
    "- **R-squared (R²):** 0.14\n",
    "\n",
    "While the R² score on the test set is similar to the baseline model (0.14), the visual comparison shows that the optimized model provides a better fit for the high-magnitude events, particularly the peak in 2024. The low R² for both models may indicate that a significant portion of the variance in dengue cases is not captured by the features used, or could suggest a model instability on the specific test set. The superior cross-validation R² of the optimized model also indicates its overall higher quality.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling process highlighted the importance of time-aware validation and feature engineering in forecasting tasks. While the R² scores remained modest, the use of lag features and hyperparameter optimization led to a more responsive model that better captures dengue seasonality and extreme case surges. This lays a strong foundation for further model experimentation, including alternative regressors and ensemble methods.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science pipeline for analyzing and forecasting dengue cases. Starting with raw data, we performed a series of crucial steps to transform it into a usable format, uncovering key insights along the way that guided our predictive modeling efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) confirmed a strong seasonal pattern in dengue outbreaks and revealed a critical finding: a significant delay between climate variables and the incidence of new cases. This insight was the foundation for our feature engineering, where we successfully incorporated lagged features into our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our machine learning efforts, using a Random Forest Regressor, established a baseline for forecasting. While the model's final R-squared score was statistically low (0.14), a visual inspection of the predictions confirms that it successfully captures the overall seasonal trends and the timing of major outbreaks, including the one in 2024. The difference between the cross-validation and test set R-squared scores suggests that there is still significant room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "For future work, the project can be expanded in several promising directions:\n",
    "* **Exploring More Advanced Models:** The next logical step is to implement more powerful models like **XGBoost**, which is well-suited for capturing complex interactions and may yield a higher predictive accuracy.\n",
    "* **Enriching the Dataset:** Incorporating additional features, such as population density, public health intervention data, or other socioeconomic indicators, could provide the model with a more complete picture of the factors that influence dengue spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this project provides a robust foundation for dengue forecasting, delivering valuable insights and a working model that can be refined to better support public health authorities in their efforts to combat the disease.  \n",
    "With further improvements, this forecasting approach has the potential to become a powerful decision-making tool for anticipating outbreaks and optimizing public health interventions in vulnerable regions.\n",
